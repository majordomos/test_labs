I never really thought you’d be my crush
You had me wrapped up in your touch
And then I found there were no substitute
But way back when there was no rush
We were scared, we cared too much
But come to think, I never had a doubt ‘bout loving you
So I just stand astounded, my heart is bare and pounding
I had a crowd around me but you stood out like a mountain
And while the words never float above my tongue
