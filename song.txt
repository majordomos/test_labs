I never really thought you’d be my crush
You had me wrapped up in your touch
And then I found there were no substitute
But way back when there was no rush
We were scared, we cared too much
But come to think, I never had a doubt ‘bout loving you
So I just stand astounded, my heart is bare and pounding
I had a crowd around me but you stood out like a mountain
And while the words never float above my tongue

I feel like I just got the chance, out of a thousand of one
Like, I swear I’m out of patience, you blew all my expectations
You were wifey in the making, if only we weren’t so young
And I wrote statements from the vacance
Our relationship were hated, animosity was blatant
But I’m saying that I’m staying
I can fight the world with you
Hand to hand and all
Cause I swear that you mean the world to me
Even if we’re so small
Yeah
